Assume there are $a,b\in X$ with $a<b$ such that there is a path from $a$ to $b$. By the intermediate value theorem, $(a,b)\subseteq X$.
Take a copy $B$ of the Cantor set contained with the interval $(a,b)$. 
Then $B$ is a nowhere dense subset of $\mathbb{R}$, but $B\cap X=B$ is uncountable, which contradicts $X$ being a Luzin set.
