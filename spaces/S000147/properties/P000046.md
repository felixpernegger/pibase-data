Assume there are $a,b\in X$ with $a<b$ such that there is a path from $a$ to $b$. By intermediate value theorem, $(a,b)\subseteq X$.
Make a copy $B$ of the (uncountable, nowhere dense) Cantor set contained with the interval $(a,b)$. 
Then $B$ is uncountable and nowhere dense with respect to $\mathbb{R}$ as well, however $B\cap X=B$, which is uncountable, and thus contradicts $X$ being a Luzin set.
