Assume $X = \bigcup_{n\in \omega}U_n$, where $U_n$ is a nowhere dense subset of $X$ for all $n \in \omega$. Due to $X$ being a subspace of $\mathbb{R}$, the $U_n$'s are also nowhere dense in $\mathbb{R}$. As $X$ is uncountable, there is an $m \in \omega$, such that $U_m \cap X=U_m$ is uncountable, which contradicts $X$ being a Luzin set.
